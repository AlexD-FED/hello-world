# hello-world
This is me:

A former Hospitality Gury becoming a Front End Developer

I am 38 years old and live with my wife and 3 yo son and another baby in the way in Weesp in the Netherlands.
Due to Covid-19 I was made redundant and now very eager to go and challenge myself into the world of Front end Development.
Hoping to secure a brighter future for me and my family. 

Thank you for reading this.

Kind regards,

AlexD-FED
