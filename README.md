# hello-world
This is me:

A former Hospitality Gury becoming a Front End Developer

I am 38 years old and live with my pregnant wife and 3 yo son in Weesp in the Netherlands.
Due to Covid-19 I have lost my job and now very eager to go a challenge myself into the world of Front end Development.
Hoping to secure a brighter future for us. 

Thank you for reading this.

Kind regards,
